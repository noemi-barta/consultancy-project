# Scibids Data Analytics Project

## Project Description

This repository contains the details of the data analytics project conducted for Scibids as part of a bootcamp validation process. As a group endeavor, the project was initially prospected and pitched by me to the class following the discussions with Scibids. My role extended beyond analytics as I coordinated the project, ensuring continuous communication and alignment with the clientâ€™s expectations.

Scibids, founded in Paris in 2016, specializes in enhancing digital marketing while upholding user privacy. They have developed a customizable AI that crafts algorithms to automate and optimize the programmatic buying of digital ad campaigns. Integrated with major Demand Side Platforms (DSPs), their AI bolsters performance without the need for user tracking or profiling, servicing major media agencies and global brands like Spotify, Allianz, and Pokerstars.

## Objective

Our team was entrusted by Scibids with the task of analyzing a substantial dataset to extract meaningful insights into client behavior, campaign performance, and to identify strategic opportunities for product engagement and expansion.

## My Contributions

As a project manager and key analyst, I:

- Initiated the prospecting and pitching phase to secure the project.
- Maintained ongoing project management and client communication/reporting post-pitch.
- Contributed to the extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data cleansing, and customer segmentation.
- Developed detailed performance analyses using Python after the completion of the presentation in class to provide comprehensive insights to the client.
- Identified seasonal trends affecting customer behavior and revenue.
- Pinpointed key clients and outliers that skewed overall analysis and conclusions.
- Contributed to the creation of Dashboards with Tableau.
- Crafted a comprehensive final presentation consisting of 79 slides, detailing findings and strategic recommendations for Scibids.
  
## Data Analytics Scope

The project involved analyzing a dataset with 144,800 entries, which, after rigorous data cleaning and EDA, was reduced to 26,795 entries. 

The analyses conducted include:
- Customer Segmentation
- Profitability Analysis
- Performance Insights
- Seasonal Trend Analysis
- Outlier Detection and Impact Analysis
  
## Technologies and Tools

- Python: For data cleaning, manipulation, and in-depth analysis.
- Tableau: For data visualization and crafting interactive dashboards.
- Google Colab: For collaborative coding and analysis sharing.
- Google Slides: For drafting and finalizing the client presentation.
- Excel and Google Sheets: For analysis, visualisation and DataFrames documentation.
- SQL: Initial EDA.
  
## Repository Contents

- Performance Analysis Script: The final Python script for comprehensive data analysis.
- Summary of the Client Presentation: A preview of the 79-slide deck summarizing findings and strategic recommendations, with insights hidden for confidentiality clause reasons.
- The template design was created in Canva following an extensive online research on their visual and brand identity.

## Data
- Initial Dataset: Started with 144,800 entries spanning various client and campaign metrics.
- Final Dataset: A refined and focused dataset of 26,795 entries post-EDA, with added columns (unified KPI, CPC, CPM) to support our analysis.

## Findings

Through our analysis, we were able to:

- Segregate clients into meaningful segments.
- Analyze client behavior and profitability across different cohorts.
- Derive actionable performance insights.
- Identify seasonal patterns in client behavior and campaign performance.
- Provide strategic recommendations to optimize Scibids' AI solution engagement and identify expansion opportunities.
  
## Final Remarks

The collaboration with Scibids was a valuable opportunity to apply data analytics in a real-world context. 
It challenged us to deliver actionable insights within a tight timeframe and to communicate these findings effectively to support business decisions.

**This project not only underscored the importance of comprehensive data analysis in strategy development but also the critical role of domain knowledge, understanding of business stakes, clear stakeholder communication and effective project management in driving a project to success.**
